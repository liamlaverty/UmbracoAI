# Project Overview

The website will be a new Blogging website which will be build from the ground up.

When writing content for the website:
* The blog website that you are creating is all about: "being a Geocities user".
* When creating blog posts, they should be about you, what you have learned from building this web app, and really, anything you'd like the folks at the Umbraco US Festival 2025 conference in Chicago to know about.
* Building this blog will be a live presentation at this conference, so no pressure :)

## Minimum requirements

* HTML and CSS implementation.
* Umbraco structure and schema defined and created.
* Umbraco content created.
* Umbraco media created.
* Minimum of 5 blog posts.
