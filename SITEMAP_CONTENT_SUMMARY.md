2. Click **"Import"**
3. All files will be imported in the correct dependency order

The sitemap will be immediately available at: `http://localhost:14737/sitemap`

## What the Sitemap Will Include

When you visit `/sitemap`, you'll see an XML file containing:
- All published pages (Home, Blog List, and all Blog posts)
- Absolute URLs for each page
- Last modified dates
- Change frequencies (daily/monthly)
- Priority values (0.6-1.0)

## Technical Implementation

The `sitemap.cshtml` template:
- Recursively traverses the content tree
- Respects the "Include in Sitemap" setting
- Only includes pages with templates
- Generates valid XML sitemap format
- Sets content-type to `application/xml`

## SEO Best Practices Applied

- Home page has highest priority (1.0) and updates daily
- Blog listing has high priority (0.8) and updates daily
- Individual posts have medium priority (0.6) and update monthly
- All pages properly configured for search engines
